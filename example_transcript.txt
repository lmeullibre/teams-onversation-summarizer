0:0:0.0 --> 0:0:3.290
Erald Keshi
So here we go. Welcome to our tech Arctic Architecture Council.
0:0:3.990 --> 0:0:6.0
Erald Keshi
And first one in June this year.
0:0:6.680 --> 0:0:9.930
Erald Keshi
And it's been a month since we had the last one, but just to reiterate.
0:0:10.670 --> 0:0:37.30
Erald Keshi
We didn't review of the SO  assessment needed by Steve Esposito. Steve Esposito went to portfolio council afterwards to present it and get whitelisting. We got that from Denmark and Finland during the portfolio Council meeting, but Sweden and Norway had to go back to to secure that. But it came rather quickly. So today we have full whitelisting log, SO from Portfolio Council as well, and the implementation is processing.
0:0:39.460 --> 0:0:39.850
Erald Keshi
Today.
0:0:40.630 --> 0:0:45.260
Erald Keshi
Good. Justin, adoption platform, that's a recommendation also led by Steve Esposito.
0:0:47.670 --> 0:0:52.820
Erald Keshi
So basically Steve Esposito, I think the stage is yours for a presentation and the discussion.
0:0:54.780 --> 0:1:1.710
Steve Esposito
Yep, I have also invited earlier, but he notified that he'll be a few minutes late due to some.
0:1:3.180 --> 0:1:5.510
Steve Esposito
Some errands that he has to run.
0:1:6.670 --> 0:1:8.350
Steve Esposito
Alright, let me share.
0:1:9.660 --> 0:1:11.910
Steve Esposito
Let me share my screen.
0:1:24.790 --> 0:1:26.410
Steve Esposito
Let me know when you can see it.
0:1:29.850 --> 0:1:30.130
Erald Keshi
Yep.
0:1:31.630 --> 0:1:31.970
PERSON C
Yep.
0:1:32.130 --> 0:1:32.480
Steve Esposito
OK.
0:1:34.80 --> 0:1:35.770
Steve Esposito
Ohh really is also here. Hi.
0:1:38.850 --> 0:1:45.240
Steve Esposito
OK, good. So today we're talking about the customer digital adoption platform.
0:1:46.700 --> 0:1:47.190
Steve Esposito
Umm.
0:1:48.320 --> 0:1:49.130
Steve Esposito
First of all.
0:1:50.0 --> 0:1:58.380
Steve Esposito
I'd like to take a step back from the main topic, but to reiterate that we are surrounded by software.
0:1:59.520 --> 0:2:5.890
Steve Esposito
Uh, it is everywhere we go. It is present in any kind of devices nowadays, starting from.
0:2:6.640 --> 0:2:17.370
Steve Esposito
Transportation like planes, cars, uh space shuttles, you know, ending with kitchen appliances, it's everywhere and it's connected and.
0:2:18.80 --> 0:2:24.460
Steve Esposito
It's getting more and more involved with with us humans and we interact.
0:2:25.350 --> 0:2:28.670
Steve Esposito
With this offer everyday and the main.
0:2:30.720 --> 0:2:49.480
Steve Esposito
The main the main thing is how the the quality of interaction, so whether that's efficient, how we interact it, can we adopt it, the software and the solution to our lives or can or we cannot, and that determines whether it, the product itself is good or not.
0:2:50.680 --> 0:2:53.270
Steve Esposito
Whether that's suitable for us and.
0:2:54.670 --> 0:3:1.380
Steve Esposito
That leads us to the term digital adoption, what it is and basically that's.
0:3:2.270 --> 0:3:3.100
Steve Esposito
That is.
0:3:4.720 --> 0:3:18.200
Steve Esposito
That is a way how to adopt any given resource you are presented with and make use of that to understand it and to use it to its best capability to serve your purpose.
0:3:19.720 --> 0:3:33.110
Steve Esposito
It's a very long description, but the shorter one would be learning how to use anything you face and why digital. Because we are talking about software. Therefore that's digital.
0:3:34.400 --> 0:3:38.320
Steve Esposito
So what articles and objectives of digital adoption?
0:3:39.880 --> 0:3:47.450
Steve Esposito
And it's very simple. I I'm fairly certain and everyone of us have seen it. So it's the.
0:3:48.520 --> 0:3:51.820
Steve Esposito
Tool tips, announcements, walkthroughs.
0:3:53.260 --> 0:3:57.80
Steve Esposito
Any kind of self service functionality guidance through.
0:3:57.230 --> 0:4:0.100
Steve Esposito
Ohm some features and whatnot.
0:4:2.0 --> 0:4:4.200
Steve Esposito
And I know it takes for the back end users.
0:4:5.30 --> 0:4:5.580
Steve Esposito
Umm.
0:4:7.140 --> 0:4:37.230
Steve Esposito
So basically, I'm sure you all have seen when you install a new app on your phone for example, there's a short guide on how to use it, or when you subscribe to a new service and a web, you get this short walkthrough with highlighting the major key features. That's basically is the adoption helper. What we are talking about today. And of course there comes many benefits with such platforms or such tools or.
0:4:37.550 --> 0:5:7.200
Steve Esposito
Augmenting augmentation of the existing tools we have or or customer services. Obviously we increase the efficiency of customer onboarding and therefore that increases the product or service usage. And when people are using the things we offer more, they are obviously spend more money which is good for us and they they can resolve their the challenges they faced themselves.
0:5:7.700 --> 0:5:33.70
Steve Esposito
And therefore reducing the the the turn and the overhead work on the back end resources like our stuff that has to go through requests and tickets and whatnot and also it helps us to launch new features faster to the market, we can be sure that something new we launch, we'll reach the customers fairly quickly because they will know about it.
0:5:34.780 --> 0:5:40.330
Steve Esposito
And So what would be the owners of such such platforms? Such tool?
0:5:40.950 --> 0:5:51.110
Steve Esposito
Umm, you know Tia that would be 2 main groups that would be ecommerce and last cycle management and there are a few applications that go under that.
0:5:51.840 --> 0:6:18.630
Steve Esposito
Umm and initial scope we have looked at Ishop cloud Portal which is ecommerce and asset management in my atea as a life cycle management applications and they will use pretty much the same thing. And what I need to point out that owners are responsible to maintain the content of the.
0:6:19.10 --> 0:6:30.810
Steve Esposito
Uh update guides of the pop ups and whatnot in their own application, so it's it's one single tool, but it's owned and managed by several groups, and those groups are.
0:6:32.270 --> 0:6:38.340
Steve Esposito
Have the full control and full ownership of anything that they put out to customers.
0:6:41.900 --> 0:6:48.570
Steve Esposito
Why we need it? Well, first of all, we don't have it. That's that would be #1 obvious.
0:6:49.830 --> 0:6:52.300
Steve Esposito
Obvious answer, but again.
0:6:53.10 --> 0:7:6.410
Steve Esposito
The market and the digital option solutions is growing rapidly and companies are investing heavily to make sure that the products and services are.
0:7:7.910 --> 0:7:31.250
Steve Esposito
Are are usable and if atea wants to be ahead of the curve and be market leader, we need to know what customers want because their needs and and wants they they change constantly in everyday basis and we want our customers to return. We want to keep in touch with our customers rather than being a one time transaction when they purchase something and leave.
0:7:32.30 --> 0:7:47.780
Steve Esposito
So we want to make our services attractive and interactive, so the the people feel like they are interacting with the services we provide and therefore are willing to use them and therefore bring more money for us.
0:7:48.710 --> 0:7:50.380
Steve Esposito
Uh, beginning revenue and.
0:7:51.720 --> 0:7:56.890
Steve Esposito
So we had, look, we had a look at number of tools with at least was very long because.
0:7:58.110 --> 0:8:0.640
Steve Esposito
The market is ever growing and.
0:8:1.370 --> 0:8:16.400
Steve Esposito
Actually, since we started looking into those solutions, uh, the market player number has increased significantly, but we had several demos. We had 6 demos with vendors and from those six we shortlisted 3.
0:8:17.180 --> 0:8:46.370
Steve Esposito
Uh, those three are PRODUCT A PRODUCT B and PRODUCT C, so shortly about all of them. PRODUCT A is one of the major players in Europe. It's it's an enterprise enterprise grade platform with very, very good usability. Anyone can create a guide. It's very flexible, very adoptable and within the package they also include the customer journey technician. So it means there's a dedicated person.
0:8:46.630 --> 0:8:48.50
Steve Esposito
That helps us to build.
0:8:48.750 --> 0:9:7.240
Steve Esposito
Anything we want and to adopt the product for our needs to our branding, to our content so that it's maximized the full potential of their platform. The second one is the PRODUCT B, it's a growing company, it's an upcoming player in the market.
0:9:8.320 --> 0:9:9.430
Steve Esposito
Also based off Europe.
0:9:10.90 --> 0:9:10.790
Steve Esposito
Umm.
0:9:11.560 --> 0:9:25.690
Steve Esposito
It is also very flexible, it's it's all it is very robust. So while it might lack some UX features, it it is very technically capable, but it's not that user friendly.
0:9:26.90 --> 0:9:29.460
Steve Esposito
Umm. However, it's it's very competitively priced.
0:9:30.450 --> 0:9:45.120
Steve Esposito
And the third one is PRODUCT C, which is it's an enterprise solution pretty much with all the bells and whistles that you would ever want and need in a solution. It's highly customizable and yeah.
0:9:46.40 --> 0:9:53.50
Steve Esposito
Also very user friendly, but that comes with the price and the price is we can see the price difference is here.
0:9:54.250 --> 0:9:54.860
Steve Esposito
Umm.
0:9:56.140 --> 0:10:1.290
Steve Esposito
So yeah, I won't go too much on those. So what is our recommendation?
0:10:2.820 --> 0:10:23.400
Steve Esposito
Most of the tools, if not all of them meet the the all basic business requirements. All the requirements we have but they, as they say, the devil is always in the detail and only in demos we could we could really see the true nature of those platforms and from all of them user lane is the.
0:10:24.260 --> 0:10:26.710
Steve Esposito
Is the best solution in our opinion.
0:10:27.580 --> 0:10:28.70
Steve Esposito
Umm.
0:10:28.990 --> 0:10:34.600
Steve Esposito
Because it's it's enterprise great, but it's not priced as enterprise solution.
0:10:35.940 --> 0:10:36.360
PERSON D
Honey.
0:10:35.560 --> 0:10:40.340
Steve Esposito
It's very capable, it's very user friendly and it has.
0:10:41.400 --> 0:10:49.0
Steve Esposito
By far the best multi language support, which is also pretty important for us as we operate in different markets.
0:10:49.930 --> 0:11:12.0
Steve Esposito
And the second one would be would be PRODUCT B because it's very, very, very good value, it's very robust and it's very straightforward. And the third one is opt, if it's really good, it's it's truly very good solution, but it's it's it's pretty pricey one. So therefore it landed on the 3rd.
0:11:12.760 --> 0:11:14.740
Steve Esposito
Uh, third place of our list.
0:11:15.700 --> 0:11:23.200
Steve Espositox
And that's pretty much the IT there's also appendix in the presentation with the data about.
0:11:26.660 --> 0:11:36.710
Steve Esposito
Deep market about case studies and metrics in our own applications, but I won't go into those at the moment.
0:11:38.450 --> 0:11:38.900
Steve Esposito
We can.
0:11:39.660 --> 0:11:41.570
Steve Esposito
I should have presentation afterwards, alright?
0:11:43.700 --> 0:11:44.180
Erald Keshi
Talking.
0:11:45.800 --> 0:11:50.110
PERSON E
So we had the similar product called PRODUCT D.
0:11:50.780 --> 0:11:51.130
Steve Esposito
Yes.
0:11:51.790 --> 0:11:56.840
PERSON E
It would be good if you at least mention it in your presentation why you didn't consider it.
0:11:57.60 --> 0:11:57.970
Steve Esposito
Ah yes.
0:11:57.660 --> 0:11:58.710
PERSON E
For for this part.
0:11:59.500 --> 0:12:1.500
Steve Esposito
Yes, so uh.
0:12:2.390 --> 0:12:7.860
Steve Esposito
We eliminated that solution because of the pricing model they have. They are.
0:12:8.20 --> 0:12:15.650
Steve Esposito
Umm, focusing on user numbers and with the customer facing user numbers we have.
0:12:16.340 --> 0:12:18.370
Steve Esposito
Uh, the price would be just unbearable.
0:12:19.780 --> 0:12:20.570
Steve Esposito
Whether as.
0:12:22.70 --> 0:12:28.760
Steve Esposito
For example PRODUCT A, they have all included package where you pay for the application and support.
0:12:29.450 --> 0:12:31.540
Steve Esposito
But they don't care how many users you have.
0:12:32.470 --> 0:12:37.50
Steve Esposito
So therefore it's, yeah, it's more reasonable to your tasks solution.
0:12:38.280 --> 0:12:40.900
PERSON E
But in the presentation it would be good if you.
0:12:40.920 --> 0:12:42.830
Steve Esposito
Yes, yes. Yeah, that's true.
0:12:41.600 --> 0:12:49.830
PERSON E
Because it was quite recently, we decided on the on that tool. So just mention it in your presentation. That would be fantastic.
0:12:50.420 --> 0:12:52.190
Steve Esposito
Yeah. Alright. Thank you. Yeah.
0:12:54.640 --> 0:13:4.90
Erald Keshi
I have a question on the pricing. I know PRODUCT C is very pricey, but it sounds like you are also really impressed by what it offers us. What is would there be anything that actually?
0:13:5.250 --> 0:13:19.680
Erald Keshi
Would allow us to pay that price in in other benefits. Is the maintenance of how you build up the the UX part is that easier to do an action than it is in PRODUCT A and could that make a make a difference on the price evaluation for us?
0:13:20.200 --> 0:13:28.290
Steve Esposito
No, I don't think so. But judging by the demos we had, they are making neck and it didn't make sense to pay double the price.
0:13:29.800 --> 0:13:34.820
Erald Keshi
And has security been involved? Is there anything we should have security involved in in this?
0:13:35.950 --> 0:13:37.410
Erald Keshi
Are we storing data anywhere?
0:13:38.370 --> 0:13:38.630
Steve Esposito
You know.
0:13:45.970 --> 0:13:47.670
Erald Keshi
OK. Other questions or comments?
0:13:49.470 --> 0:13:50.40
PERSON F
Yep.
0:13:48.270 --> 0:14:17.730
Sergi M. Rodriguez
Yeah, I have some first stuff I I think we need to include the PRODUCT D as you say, because someone will ask later on a year from now, you know, what the heck do you do not consider it. So it needs to be in here. That's kind of evidence for it. The other part I have is that as we go to portfolio Council, we always ask for position it into the North Star architecture and we should have it here as part of the ITECH as well. So we can reuse that later on. But that's for the future, right. But we need to have it in here because it will be reused as soon as you go to portfolio Council.
0:14:19.420 --> 0:14:37.230
Sergi M. Rodriguez
3rd Part I have is you know what kind of tool is this because I have a little bit of an issue to position this. To me it's the tools and methods application or tool set. You know something that you use to enhance other tools. It's not a tool that that you provide to the end user directly.
0:14:38.200 --> 0:14:41.870
Sergi M. Rodriguez
So it's it's something that that I enrich other solutions.
0:14:42.830 --> 0:14:49.110
Sergi M. Rodriguez
And thereby I believe it's it's part of the enabling platforms and so on and not owned by an application itself.
0:14:51.220 --> 0:15:1.890
Sergi M. Rodriguez
But is there another view of this? Because this is, you know, I see that it's can as well support dynamics in the future and so on, right? If we want to implement that, it's a, it's a great platform to do that.
0:15:5.570 --> 0:15:7.210
Steve Esposito
Yes, I guess, yeah.
0:15:5.800 --> 0:15:12.490
PERSON E
I would, I would follow up and I want and have it. Could we used it for PRODUCT E instead of the PRODUCT D. Now could we have one too?
0:15:14.180 --> 0:15:14.870
Steve Esposito
We could have, yeah.
0:15:16.200 --> 0:15:30.230
PERSON H
But I think the major selling point of as I believe PRODUCT D and that's please correct me if I'm wrong, was that PRODUCT E the water of the main requirements was for it to integrate with the classical interface.
0:15:31.210 --> 0:15:32.20
PERSON E
That was both.
0:15:31.440 --> 0:15:32.450
PERSON H
But only if you are.
0:15:34.670 --> 0:15:35.150
PERSON E
Uh.
0:15:36.120 --> 0:15:37.170
PERSON I
True, true.
0:15:38.50 --> 0:15:38.490
PERSON I
Sorry.
0:15:38.800 --> 0:15:39.90
PERSON E
Yeah.
0:15:37.820 --> 0:15:41.470
PERSON H
So so I I I I don't believe PRODUCT A is capable of doing that.
0:15:42.840 --> 0:15:48.800
Sergi M. Rodriguez
But it needs to be checked, right? Because it's it is a possibility there as well. If it has not been put in play yet N PRODUCT D.
0:15:49.890 --> 0:15:52.230
Sergi M. Rodriguez
We should at least raise it that this is a possibility.
0:15:53.140 --> 0:16:5.840
Sergi M. Rodriguez
I know that all guests not on the call, but you know this is this is a very wide platform, it can, it can provide a lot of value to not only the selected applications that Elias on to be sunbrella but a lot of the other possibilities as well, right.
0:16:7.540 --> 0:16:7.780
Steve Esposito
Yes.
0:16:8.710 --> 0:16:21.150
Steve Esposito
Well, initially it was the main requirements that were discussed were were for customer facing applications and yeah. But of course we can expand that because they also of course offer.
0:16:21.810 --> 0:16:22.330
Steve Esposito
Umm.
0:16:23.270 --> 0:16:31.230
Steve Esposito
Offer any kind of internal patient support as well, including SAT which is mentioned in their site as a customer. So.
0:16:39.860 --> 0:16:40.30
Steve Esposito
Yeah.
0:16:31.840 --> 0:16:43.690
Sergi M. Rodriguez
Because even if the other doesn't have a requirement today, it would be bad if we bring yet another doc tool just because dynamics needs once and PRODUCT E needs one, and then catalyst one believes that they need something and we're being in a fourth one.
0:16:45.610 --> 0:16:46.10
Steve Esposito
Yeah.
0:16:45.430 --> 0:16:52.200
Sergi M. Rodriguez
So it would be nice to have one, you know, this kind covers everything. If you want to go away from this one. Sure, you can do that, but you need a good reason for it.
0:16:53.800 --> 0:16:54.110
Steve Esposito
OK.
0:16:56.880 --> 0:16:57.180
Steve Esposito
Right.
0:16:59.590 --> 0:17:0.0
Steve Esposito
Yes.
0:16:57.770 --> 0:17:0.160
PERSON F
I raised my hand, maybe.
0:17:0.350 --> 0:17:0.600
PERSON F
OK.
0:16:59.460 --> 0:17:0.920
Erald Keshi
Yes, your turn.
0:17:5.100 --> 0:17:16.90
PERSON F
I missed the store to the meeting. Sorry for that. So I don't know what is this service is doing. I don't know if it's in service or it's an on Prem solution but doesn't it process any of atea data?
0:17:18.980 --> 0:17:25.640
Steve Esposito
Uh, not really. It's a it's a sad solution. It's basically.
0:17:26.460 --> 0:17:36.20
Steve Esposito
Courtney, but that is added to the web page which invokes a JavaScript library which is like an overlay of highlighting elements in a page.
0:17:38.240 --> 0:17:38.870
PERSON F
OK.
0:17:37.70 --> 0:17:39.640
Steve Esposito
Umm, it doesn't store any kind of user data.
0:17:40.250 --> 0:17:40.800
PERSON F
OK.
0:17:40.250 --> 0:17:43.460
PERSON E
You're you remember Clipper. He's like you're that old.
0:17:43.910 --> 0:17:44.560
PERSON F
Yeah.
0:17:44.600 --> 0:17:48.270
PERSON E
Yeah. So this is a Clipper for the the the next generation.
0:17:47.660 --> 0:17:49.230
PERSON F
OK, OK.
0:17:48.950 --> 0:17:54.210
PERSON D
It's like is this the same one we've had in in Montrose, the little guy in the down left corner?
0:17:54.770 --> 0:17:55.740
PERSON F
Yeah. OK.
0:17:55.580 --> 0:17:57.190
PERSON D
That's the that's PRODUCT A.
0:17:58.950 --> 0:18:6.890
Sergi M. Rodriguez
But but there isn't analytics part a shared as part of PRODUCT A. What kind of analytics is that and what kind of data is it based on?
0:18:7.930 --> 0:18:24.820
Steve Esposito
It counts like how many clicks there wasn't a particular notification that we publish. Or let's say there's a walkthrough guide and it just monitors how many users have completed the guide on which that the majority have dropped and so forth.
0:18:25.620 --> 0:18:26.630
PERSON F
OK, so let's.
0:18:25.730 --> 0:18:28.600
Steve Esposito
Without indicating any kind of user identity.
0:18:32.180 --> 0:18:33.900
PERSON F
OK, then I rest my case.
0:18:38.660 --> 0:18:39.240
Erald Keshi
And the other.
0:18:38.420 --> 0:19:3.620
Sergi M. Rodriguez
So I I have more. Of course I have more when it comes to maintaining this one. I understand that you know my atea and so on will use this right and actually point out there they will take care of of using it. They will learn how about it and so on do we need to add more people or more effort to the teams that are currently in place or you know how how do they get this kind of training and this kind of new skill.
0:19:6.390 --> 0:19:11.690
Steve Esposito
40 myatea part we had meetings with Daniel and.
0:19:12.480 --> 0:19:24.640
Steve Esposito
Hello I think ohh and they are taking over that they have the capabilities and resources to do that for each shop. I think it was a kind of remember who it was but basically.
0:19:25.820 --> 0:19:26.50
Steve Esposito
OK.
0:19:23.980 --> 0:19:26.690
Sergi M. Rodriguez
I think it is is is ready to jump in.
0:19:27.40 --> 0:19:29.90
Steve Esposito
Yes, that would be better, I think.
0:19:30.830 --> 0:19:42.690
PERSON J
It is of course true that that we have agreed. Let me start a little bit different. Keep in mind this is for customer oriented systems. That is how the demand started all the way back in March 21.
0:19:43.950 --> 0:19:48.280
PERSON J
For my atea, for ACP, for E shop and Atea asset management.
0:19:49.80 --> 0:19:56.330
PERSON J
And all four of them being customer oriented, that's also the pricing scheme will PRODUCT E. Now as we have established.
0:19:58.440 --> 0:20:7.40
PERSON J
We have also looked at each other and work with each other throughout this process with the help of robots and Alex that we will.
0:20:8.0 --> 0:20:13.590
PERSON J
Find the needed time and resources to both enable and work with this focused.
0:20:14.810 --> 0:20:41.160
PERSON J
So we can utilize it to some extent. We will free up a little bit of time in regards to support as we have now in regards to giving customers information about new features and eShop, new features and ACP or what it is and guiding customers, onboarding customers into the different systems. So a little bit of time we'll be freed up there. That is a clear expectation.
0:20:42.170 --> 0:21:11.950
PERSON J
And in the little bit longer run, we have a very small team sitting in the chat service center and Riga right now that is doing on a regular basis AC some ACP work that will go away actually on June 13th when something in ACP related to ACP will be closed down. So the thinking and the plan is also to utilize that little team for this and build the needed expertise.
0:21:12.400 --> 0:21:21.990
PERSON J
On on it. That's the work right now. We need to get experience. Atea does customer Orient that not have any solution of the kind available today?
0:21:23.550 --> 0:21:37.160
PERSON J
So we also need to figure out how to work with it and also see how customers react on it going forward. If this is also something to be used in internal systems, obviously make sense.
0:21:37.650 --> 0:21:44.160
PERSON J
If it's as good and powerful as Sara PRODUCT E, I don't know.
0:21:45.240 --> 0:21:52.900
PERSON J
As Steve Esposito puts it, we looked at different solution. He, Steve Esposito did the initial screening of the of the market.
0:21:54.180 --> 0:22:26.790
PERSON J
Put forward some suggestion, had demos talked about it, looked at it and and that is how PRODUCT A came out to be. The recommended solution from our side, from the business side. That is how we look at it because it also looked as it looks it is rather easy to go to and get going with it. On top of that, PRODUCT A has offered quite a rather rather big project onboarding plan fast and we will find the time to get it done.
0:22:26.890 --> 0:22:38.930
PERSON J
In the different portals, not immediately from Monday morning, if obviously it it takes a little bit of time, but we will do it throughout the summer and fall and get it enabled, yes.
0:22:40.510 --> 0:22:44.10
Sergi M. Rodriguez
So if I summarize, that means that the existing team will be able to cover it.
0:22:43.680 --> 0:22:44.130
PERSON J
Yes.
0:22:44.870 --> 0:22:46.500
PERSON J
In all four solutions, yeah.
0:22:46.860 --> 0:22:52.50
Sergi M. Rodriguez
Then I think we should put that in. So it's clear that there are no additional expectations.
0:22:51.580 --> 0:22:59.170
PERSON J
Oh, that was that was data on one of the slides. If you go back a little bit, actually I think it was stated on slide.
0:23:0.700 --> 0:23:1.530
PERSON J
Slide 6.
0:23:2.520 --> 0:23:5.120
PERSON J
Ownership under the ownership slot. If you show that.
0:23:6.570 --> 0:23:7.10
PERSON J
Robert.
0:23:14.680 --> 0:23:15.380
Steve Esposito
As mentioned.
0:23:16.200 --> 0:23:16.910
Steve Esposito
Just want to.
0:23:15.520 --> 0:23:19.780
Sergi M. Rodriguez
I don't see anything around the getting you need it for increased budgets or not, but.
0:23:24.610 --> 0:23:24.870
Sergi M. Rodriguez
Yeah.
0:23:20.860 --> 0:23:28.200
PERSON J
Owners of the tap I also responsible for the resource implementation complementarians of the application costs associated with it, yes.
0:23:31.780 --> 0:23:32.770
Steve Esposito
Yes it does.
0:23:31.810 --> 0:23:32.900
PERSON J
Ohh that is correct.
0:23:28.530 --> 0:23:34.970
Sergi M. Rodriguez
Yeah, but it doesn't say if we need to add resources or not. So let's just state that the existing team can take care of it.
0:23:35.440 --> 0:23:35.750
PERSON J
Yeah.
0:23:36.850 --> 0:23:37.300
PERSON J
Kind of.
0:23:40.880 --> 0:23:47.610
Sergi M. Rodriguez
So there's no need to expand or anything like that from a runtime or anything like that, which is great. Just just the license that needs them to be put in place.
0:23:49.280 --> 0:23:50.120
Sergi M. Rodriguez
But it's just.
0:23:47.370 --> 0:23:50.510
PERSON J
Yeah, yeah. Being allowed to do use it.
0:23:51.580 --> 0:23:51.800
Sergi M. Rodriguez
Right.
0:23:52.640 --> 0:23:53.590
PERSON J
That is what we need.
0:23:54.360 --> 0:23:57.250
PERSON J
And the money that is a portfolio Council.
0:23:59.670 --> 0:24:5.890
Sergi M. Rodriguez
And and what if they portfolio Council views that is to you know, if they push you back to the less expensive number too?
0:24:6.830 --> 0:24:7.780
Sergi M. Rodriguez
What will be the?
0:24:8.450 --> 0:24:13.190
Sergi M. Rodriguez
Disadvantage of going with that one? Do we fail in some areas or what will happen?
0:24:18.420 --> 0:24:18.760
Steve Esposito
On.
0:24:19.610 --> 0:24:19.880
Steve Esposito
Yeah.
0:24:18.180 --> 0:24:24.540
Sergi M. Rodriguez
How's it if I put like this? How's #2 even being checked from a security and so on perspective, you know it's.
0:24:25.200 --> 0:24:42.0
Sergi M. Rodriguez
We only have one option that we are putting forward, right? But I my question is just you know pure on financials, if they say the other one is so less expensive, we suggest you go with that one unless you see big issues with it and you don't have any big issues, there is a risk that they are pushing you back into that one.
0:24:44.860 --> 0:25:3.250
PERSON J
I don't see immediately thinking back about the demos, the dialogues where we were involved, where I was involved. I don't see any big issues to going to number 2. I don't expect them just from a cost perspective because at the is my father most expensive one. I don't see any problems with inline.
0:25:3.880 --> 0:25:8.870
PERSON J
The back end, all the the administration off it seems.
0:25:10.190 --> 0:25:10.940
PERSON J
Easier.
0:25:11.840 --> 0:25:27.470
PERSON J
To work with when we talk about PRODUCT A then it will PRODUCT B. But I don't see any functionality per se. We lose by going with for example PRODUCT B. No, I don't definitely I don't see that immediately.
0:25:28.10 --> 0:25:29.350
PERSON J
Yeah, I would.
0:25:31.480 --> 0:25:32.960
PERSON J
Yeah, the.
0:25:34.370 --> 0:25:34.540
PERSON J
Yeah.
0:25:35.610 --> 0:25:35.890
PERSON J
Yeah.
0:25:27.550 --> 0:25:36.340
Sergi M. Rodriguez
But for help us then, then PRODUCT A is quicker to adopt and get in. So we will be more speed. I would say that would be the main advantage of getting used to Langdon.
0:25:46.770 --> 0:25:47.20
Sergi M. Rodriguez
No.
0:25:36.800 --> 0:25:49.630
PERSON J
Absolutely. That is what we that is why it ended up with user laid. Of course there are functionality differences that one solution has over the other. It's always like that.
0:25:57.810 --> 0:25:58.110
PERSON J
No.
0:25:58.840 --> 0:25:59.40
PERSON J
Yeah.
0:25:50.20 --> 0:26:1.800
Sergi M. Rodriguez
I understand the The thing is that you have no big pros, sorry cons about any of them, right? All of them look good. One of the big cons with the third one, that is expensive, but nothing really differs between one and two.
0:26:1.550 --> 0:26:32.880
PERSON J
No, no technical, per SE technical right things I have to think about again the back end. That is where PRODUCT A by the looks of it from what we've seen have been introduced to looks easier to handle and manage and work with than the others PRODUCT B which seems more like a less mature solution by that. And by that the administration office seems more technical, let's say it's this way and given the fact that it will be.
0:26:33.660 --> 0:26:37.430
PERSON J
Not necessarily. Hot core technical people needing to work with this.
0:26:38.620 --> 0:26:42.270
PERSON J
That that is PRODUCT A then easier to go to as it looks.
0:26:43.490 --> 0:26:43.860
Sergi M. Rodriguez
OK.
0:26:47.140 --> 0:26:57.350
PERSON E
Yes, for from the assessment, which one are the the would you consider being the best partner for us who will be like listen to our demands and our.
0:26:58.640 --> 0:27:2.50
PERSON E
The time lines? Or would we just be another customer?
0:27:3.30 --> 0:27:4.770
PERSON E
Of those, the the choices you have done.
0:27:17.220 --> 0:27:17.720
PERSON E
Yeah.
0:27:6.360 --> 0:27:27.190
Steve Esposito
PRODUCT A an empty because they are more focused on product, they are more flexible than the flexibility is built into the product that can adapt to customers more and they are willing to put out like a customer success engineer because with PRODUCT B they are very tight knit company and what you see is what you get.
0:27:28.400 --> 0:27:29.40
PERSON E
Yeah. So.
0:27:30.20 --> 0:27:31.150
PERSON E
Write that in the.
0:27:32.110 --> 0:27:32.910
PERSON E
PDM.
0:27:33.520 --> 0:27:33.770
Sergi M. Rodriguez
Umm.
0:27:34.490 --> 0:27:34.710
Steve Esposito
Yeah.
0:27:37.420 --> 0:27:37.730
PERSON J
Yeah.
0:27:34.270 --> 0:27:40.370
PERSON E
The summaries because we're looking for a good partner, we really want to have the a partnership with the vendor.
0:27:41.130 --> 0:27:58.420
PERSON J
What I from a business perspective real like with PRODUCT A, they actually when they prepared came to the demonstration meeting, there were very well prepared, they knew who we were atea that's a big plus. Trust me, one of the others didn't even know who we were. That didn't take the time to prepare properly.
0:27:59.790 --> 0:28:23.750
PERSON J
PRODUCT A actually also forwarded a business opportunity for five atea if we want to sell PRODUCT A in our market, totally different discussion doesn't have anything to do. What we are looking at here, but they say, hey, if you are interested in selling PRODUCT A, we can give you this deal also on top of that. That shows me that are very interested they are.
0:28:24.670 --> 0:28:39.750
PERSON J
Well, in front of the bus, so to speak, they see an opportunity with us. So not just another customer, but that dialogue needs to be taken somewhere completely different if we are to resell also that solution and now our market.
0:28:41.140 --> 0:28:45.670
PERSON J
But that just shows me they think that step further ahead.
0:28:51.940 --> 0:28:52.180
PERSON J
Yep.
0:28:53.130 --> 0:28:54.0
Erald Keshi
Are there comments?
0:28:56.870 --> 0:29:0.100
Sergi M. Rodriguez
We need to update the the ownership part.
0:29:0.870 --> 0:29:3.20
Sergi M. Rodriguez
There can only be 1 owner at the end of it.
0:29:4.50 --> 0:29:18.230
Sergi M. Rodriguez
And I need to have this more as an enabling. It's perfectly fine that this is all for ecommerce life cycle management and the stakeholders in here, but it is impossibility later on to also open up for others and we should make sure that that is understood.
0:29:19.500 --> 0:29:21.40
Erald Keshi
And that could come faster actually.
0:29:21.600 --> 0:29:43.450
Sergi M. Rodriguez
Yes, but I I think it's a great thing. You know, if he commerce and life cycle management needs it, then we should push this forward. They would be the first one out, but it also has added value that others can actually tap into this platform and do more. So if you have another eShop or another smart business solution, right, we have a ready to go dig to the adoption platform which is great.
0:29:45.420 --> 0:29:59.820
PERSON J
As a on the we updated the slide deck for the Portfolio Council slightly. Also take notes here. The ADS ownership for this one in within a DS will be PERSON K.
0:30:1.910 --> 0:30:2.220
PERSON J
Well.
0:30:2.820 --> 0:30:3.50
Erald Keshi
Don't.
0:30:1.460 --> 0:30:3.420
Sergi M. Rodriguez
Yeah, I know that that is in there today.
0:30:6.320 --> 0:30:6.790
Erald Keshi
This is.
0:30:9.90 --> 0:30:9.350
Sergi M. Rodriguez
OK.
0:30:6.860 --> 0:30:10.960
PERSON J
With a slide deck for the Portfolio Council, so sorry for not.
0:30:12.190 --> 0:30:12.720
Erald Keshi
Get away.
0:30:12.230 --> 0:30:20.550
PERSON J
Yeah, forgetting to put that line in here, but to have a very clear ownership, PERSON K. And of course she has been part of that dialogue obviously also.
0:30:22.410 --> 0:30:22.780
Erald Keshi
Cookies.
0:30:22.860 --> 0:30:23.220
Sergi M. Rodriguez
Bigger.
0:30:24.210 --> 0:30:24.680
PERSON J
Thank you.
0:30:28.230 --> 0:30:37.30
Sergi M. Rodriguez
At very quick question, I know this is not for the ITAC yeah, but the the pricing that you have for the portfolio Council that covers all these four applications, right?
0:30:37.220 --> 0:30:39.60
Erald Keshi
Some of the elbow sticking cookies.
0:30:38.260 --> 0:30:47.650
PERSON J
Correct the pricing for the license is €99,000 from a year, not a month, a year for those four applications.
0:30:48.840 --> 0:31:10.650
PERSON J
There is. I set up implementation for the setup implementation project for 19,000. That means the first year it's 100 and 18,000 as it was stated and going forward year over year it's 99,000 for those four applications, each additional license and that is the good thing here. The very good thing the cost is 36,000 a year.
0:31:11.590 --> 0:31:33.610
PERSON J
No matter how many users and that was very important here. As Steve Esposito stated, we actually do not know how many users we have in ACP in my atea in eShop in AM. We know it now, but going forward we we we don't know so alone from the that.
0:31:34.330 --> 0:31:59.700
PERSON J
Perspective. Having a system that is licensed per user by active user or just per user isn't does not work for atea. We of course from the pricing had already PERSON L having a good dialogue with him and let's say it's this way he got it down from 200 and €12,000 for the first year to the 100 and 18,000.
0:32:2.130 --> 0:32:2.460
Sergi M. Rodriguez
Yeah.
0:32:2.210 --> 0:32:6.850
PERSON J
And the yearly payment down from 144 to 99.
0:32:7.890 --> 0:32:9.480
PERSON J
For those four applications.
0:32:12.50 --> 0:32:12.420
Sergi M. Rodriguez
They're good.
0:32:13.470 --> 0:32:15.280
PERSON J
So he has done his magic already.
0:32:16.380 --> 0:32:17.460
PERSON J
If that's more.
0:32:16.290 --> 0:32:17.560
Sergi M. Rodriguez
But let's see if we can do more.
0:32:18.200 --> 0:32:29.850
PERSON J
If there's more to be done, if we come with ten additional applications instead of each one being 36,000, while that is his magic, then hopefully.
0:32:29.460 --> 0:32:33.200
Sergi M. Rodriguez
Great, OK. But it covers initial scope, which is good.
0:32:33.210 --> 0:32:33.630
PERSON J
Yes.
0:32:33.870 --> 0:32:36.230
Sergi M. Rodriguez
Well, we should just clarify that as well, yeah.
0:32:40.860 --> 0:32:41.230
Sergi M. Rodriguez
OK.
0:32:42.610 --> 0:32:43.460
PERSON J
Happy thing else.
0:32:43.10 --> 0:32:44.130
Erald Keshi
Any other questions?
0:32:45.740 --> 0:32:56.180
Erald Keshi
If not, then I'll please ask anybody who has a solid reason of why PERSON J and Steve Esposito should not take this to portfolio Council on Thursday next week to speak up.
0:32:58.270 --> 0:33:0.720
PERSON J
I'll keep quiet forever. It's like when you get married.
0:33:1.540 --> 0:33:2.170
Erald Keshi
Exactly.
0:33:2.890 --> 0:33:4.560
Erald Keshi
I was trying to get to that point earlier.
0:33:5.430 --> 0:33:6.80
PERSON J
Sorry.
0:33:17.180 --> 0:33:17.370
PERSON J
Yeah.
0:33:9.710 --> 0:33:19.760
Erald Keshi
Doesn't seem to be the case, so we look forward to seeing that next Thursday in coverage Council and wish you the best of luck there. If you think we are hungry lions waiting to attack.
0:33:20.940 --> 0:33:21.490
Erald Keshi
Just wait.
0:33:26.200 --> 0:33:26.630
Erald Keshi
No, but.
0:33:27.710 --> 0:33:28.10
Erald Keshi
Yep.
0:33:24.910 --> 0:33:33.600
PERSON J
Good. Then I will jump out and you continue your meeting because I guess you don't need me anymore. And thank you for having me today. Have fun. Bye.
0:33:33.870 --> 0:33:34.660
Erald Keshi
Thanks, PERSON J. See you.
0:33:34.100 --> 0:33:35.210
PERSON H
Thank you. Bye.
0:33:35.530 --> 0:33:35.870
Steve Esposito
All right.
0:33:45.530 --> 0:33:47.300
Erald Keshi
So back to the agenda for today.
0:33:50.560 --> 0:34:20.320
Erald Keshi
And next week we will have pre study from PERSON L is planned to be on the agenda for for Thursday next week and also postal address validation service assessment done by second. Those are the plans we have. Second is going to ITAC junior on Monday with this. So that could of course postpone it and I know PERSON L is also finalizing everything but this is the plan topics for next week's agenda. Also be aware that on June 23rd we don't have ITAC.
0:34:20.430 --> 0:34:24.850
Erald Keshi
It's it's a national holiday in Latvia, so we would be very few people in in the meeting.
0:34:26.10 --> 0:34:33.190
Erald Keshi
And that's for today is just an open mic session. Anybody who has anything to raise in the ITAC, you're free to do so now.
0:34:35.270 --> 0:34:35.580
Erald Keshi
Yep.
0:34:34.0 --> 0:34:56.670
Sergi M. Rodriguez
I have again going forward, I would like to see the North Star picture into the ITAC and just for information where we go to the portfolio Council, we also trying to highlight where we hit the must win battles or where we hit the strategies. You know the strategy 2024 if you can map it to that, it will make the session in portfolio Council so much easier.
0:34:57.520 --> 0:35:6.420
Sergi M. Rodriguez
So if we if it's possible as further add in you know, otherwise it's business that needs to explain where it fits into be strategy. But we need to provide them with a North Star fit.
0:35:7.70 --> 0:35:8.560
Sergi M. Rodriguez
Uh child them out.
0:35:15.930 --> 0:35:16.370
Erald Keshi
Noted.
0:35:20.380 --> 0:35:26.640
Erald Keshi
Nothing else. Thank you all for attending. Thanks for the good questions and the discussion. That's why we're here. See you next Thursday.
0:35:27.900 --> 0:35:28.630
